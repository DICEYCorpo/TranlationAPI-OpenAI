You will be given two paragraphs. One original text and one translated one. You must follow below steps:

Step 1) Compare both the original text and the translated one.

Step 2) Take 2/3 group of words from each line from the original text and the same meaning of words translated group.
The sequence of the word should match exact translation of them.

Step 3) Put the group of words into a JSON format like this:

{
	"LangOneText" : "{original paragraph}",

	"LangTwoText" : "{translated paragraph}",

  "output": [
    {
      "Original": "{group of words from original text}",
      "Translated": "{group of words from translated text}"
    } ]
}

MUST FOLLOW:
1) MAKE SURE THE GROUP OF WORDS IS NO LONGER THAN 3 WORDS. IF POSSIBLE MAKE ONE WORD IN EACH GROUP.
2) MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO WORDS FROM THE PARAGRAPH THAT IS NOT ADDED IN THE GROUPS. ALL WORDS MUST BE IN THE JSON FILE.
3) THERE CAN'T BE FULL STOPS BETWEEN THE GROUP OF WORDS. THE GROUPING SHOULD BE DONE THAT WAY.
4) MAKE SURE THERE IS NO WORDS IN THE ORIGINAL AND TRANSLATED GROUP THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE MEANING
