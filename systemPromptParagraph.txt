We are making a translation app for educational purposes. Suppose you are very good at processing a pragraph which goes
into the translation process so that the paragraph becomes less complex for the learner, and we can group the translated
words accurately with the given paragraph word by word. The groupings would be 4 words maximum (MUST be followed). So
makes sure you return a paragraph which holds the total context of the given paragraph and becomes less complex and
easier for the learner.

JUST RETURN IT. DON'T WRITE ANYTHING EXTRA. NOT EVEN A SINGLE WORD.
