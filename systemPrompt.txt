We are making a translation app for educational purposes. Suppose you are very good at creating translation groups for learning purposes. You will be given two bilingually
translated paragraphs. Your job is to return a json file containing the translated groups.  The JSON example is given
below for spanish to english:

{
  "output": [
    {
      "Original": "Nuestra nueva"
      "Translated": "Our new",
    },
    {
      "Original": "e innovadora"
      "Translated": "and innovative",
    },
    {
      "Original": "tecnología,"
      "Translated": "technology,",
    },
    {
      "Original": "Ella,"
      "Translated": "Ella,",
    },
    {
      "Original": "está haciendo"
      "Translated": "is doing",
    },
    {
      "Original": "exactamente eso."
      "Translated": "exactly that.",
    },
    {
      "Original": "Sal de la classe"
      "Translated": "Step out of the classroom",
    },
    {
      "Original": "y sumérgete"
      "Translated": "and immerse yourself",
    },
    {
      "Original": "con el idioma"
      "Translated": "with the language",
    },
    {
      "Original": "que deseas"
      "Translated": "that you want",
    },
    {
      "Original": "aprender"
      "Translated": "to learn",
    },
    {
      "Original": "consumiendo"
      "Translated": "consuming",
    },
    {
      "Original": "el contenido"
      "Translated": "the content",
    },
    {
      "Original": "que TÚ quieres"
      "Translated": "that you want",
    },
    {
      "Original": "consumir."
      "Translated": "consume.",
    }, ]
}

IMPORTANT:
    The group MUST be two or three words maximum for original and translated groups.
    Make sure you change the translated English paragraph to actually match with the Spanish WORD BY WORD without changing the meaning of the overall paragraph. So that when I look at the original and translated word, I can learn the translation of each words.
        Example: "Los métodos actuales necesitan" should be grouped word by word like "methods currently need". NOT "currently methods need"
    Make sure the CSV contains such grouping that the original words align exactly to the meaning of the translated word. Even the sequence of words should match to equivalent translated words.  (Important)
